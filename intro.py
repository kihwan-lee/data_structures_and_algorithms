#1.2 ----------------- GETTING STARTED 

#1.3 ----------------- WHAT IS COMPUTER SCIENCE?

'''
Computer science is the study of problems, problem-solving, and the solutions that come out of the problem-solving process. 

We say that a problem is computable if an algorithm exists for solving it.

Algorithm:
- Step by step list of instructions for solving and unstrance of the problem that might arise
- Finite processes taht if followed will solve the problem
- Algorithms are solutions

Abstraction:
- Allows us to view the problem and solution in such a way as to separate the so-called logical and physical perspectives
- Logical Perspective: Interface, The User
- Physical Perspective: "Under the Hood", The Programmer

- Procedural Abstraction:
  - We do not necessarily know how an operation is being performed but we know what the function is called and how to use it.
  - We describe the interface: the name of the funciton, what is needed(the parameters), and what will be returned. The details of the actual operation is hidden inside.

#1.3.1 ----------------- WHAT IS PROGRAMMING?

'''
Programming:
- Process of taking an algorithm and executing it by a computer
- Without an algorithm there can be no program

Data Types:
- Provide an interpretation for binary data so that we can think about the data in terms that make sense
- Primitive data types provide the building blocks for algorithm development
'''
#1.3.2 ----------------- WHY STUDY DATA STRUCTURES & ABSTRACT DATA TYPES?

'''
To manage the complexity of problems and the problem-solving process, computer scientists use abstractions to allow them to focus on the “big picture” without getting lost in the details.

Information Hiding: 
- By encapsulating the details of the implementation, we are hiding them from the user’s view

How an abstract data type operates:
- The user interacts with the interface, using the operations that have been specified by the abstract data type
- The abstract data type is the shell that the user interacts with
- The implementation is hidden one level deeper
- The user is not concerned with the details of the implementation
