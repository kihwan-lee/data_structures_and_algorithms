#1.3 ----------------- WHAT IS COMPUTER SCIENCE?

'''
Computer science is the study of problems, problem-solving, and the solutions that come out of the problem-solving process. Given a problem, a computer scientistâ€™s goal is to develop an algorithm, a step-by-step list of instructions for solving any instance of the problem that might arise. Algorithms are finite processes that if followed will solve the problem. Algorithms are solutions.


We say that a problem is computable if an algorithm exists for solving it.
