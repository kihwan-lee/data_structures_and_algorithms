# 4.3 ----------------- WHAT IS A STACK?

'''
Stack:
- An ordered collection of items where the addition of new items and the removal of existing items always takes place at the same end.
  This end is commonly referred to as the "top".
  The end opposite of the top is known as the "base".
  Example: 
  Think of a stack of books.
  If we want to add one, we add it to the top, because it is much easier (and faster) than lifting the whole stack of books up and adding one to the bottom.

- The base of the stack is significant since items stored in the stack that are closer to the base represent those that have beeen in 
the stack the longest.

- LIFO: Last-in first-out
  - The most recently added item is the one that is in position to be removed first.
  - This principle provides an ordering based on length of time in the collection. 
  - Newer items are near the top, while older items are near the base. 

Strength of Stacks:
- GREAT for reversing the order of items. 
- Keeping track of state or when things have occured.
