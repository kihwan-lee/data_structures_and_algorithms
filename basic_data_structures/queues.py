# 4.10 ----------------- WHAT IS A QUEUE?

'''
Explanation:
  - A queue is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items happens at one end, called the "rear".
  - The removal of existing items occurs at the other end, commonly called the "front".
  - As an element enters the queue it starts at the rear and makes its way toward the front, waiting until that time when it is the next element to be removed.
  - There is no jumping in the middle and no leaving before you have waited the necessary amount of time to get to the front.


FIFO: First In, First Out
  - The most recently added item in the queue must wait at the end of the collection. 
  - The item that has been in the collection the longest is at the front. 
  - Also known as "first come, first served".

Examples:
  - Waiting in line for a movie, check-out line at a grocery store, waiting in a cafeteria line
